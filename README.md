# üìö Tutorial: Building an NFT Card Game with Ink! Smart Contract

This tutorial will guide you through the process of building an NFT-based card game using Ink!, the smart contract language for the Polkadot ecosystem. You'll implement essential components of the game, including card creation, ownership transfer, and gameplay mechanics.

## üìù Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:

1. **ü¶Ä Rust**: Install Rust and set up your environment.
   - Install Rust: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
   - Add the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:
     ```bash
     rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
     ```

2. **üíª Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Set up VS Code for Rust and Ink! development.
   - Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install the following extensions in VS Code:
     - **Rust Extension**:
       - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
       - Search for "Rust" and install the [Rust extension by rust-lang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust).
     - **Ink! Extension**:
       - In the Extensions view, search for "Ink!" and install the [Ink! extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ParityTechnologies.ink-vscode).
     - **Rust Analyzer Extension (Recommended)**:
       - This extension provides enhanced Rust language support, including code completion and inline error checking.
       - Search for "Rust Analyzer" in the Extensions view and install the [Rust Analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer).

### üì¶ Setup on Different Operating Systems

[OS-specific setup instructions remain the same as in the original tutorial]

## üöÄ Step 1: Set Up a New Ink! Project

Create a new Ink! project for your NFT card game contract.

```bash
cargo contract new nft_card_game
cd nft_card_game
```

This will create a basic Ink! project structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Update Cargo.toml

Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project and update the dependencies:

```toml
[package]
name = "nft_card_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["[Your Name] <[your_email@example.com]>"]
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
ink = { version = "4.3", default-features = false }

scale = { package = "parity-scale-codec", version = "3", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
scale-info = { version = "2.9", default-features = false, features = ["derive"], optional = true }

[dev-dependencies]
ink_e2e = "4.3"

[lib]
path = "lib.rs"

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
    "ink/std",
    "scale/std",
    "scale-info/std",
]
ink-as-dependency = []
e2e-tests = []
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step 3: Implement NFT Card Game Logic

Replace the contents of `lib.rs` with the following code:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod nft_card_game {
    use ink::storage::Mapping;

    #[derive(scale::Decode, scale::Encode, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Copy, Clone)]
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
    pub enum Error {
        NotOwner,
        TokenNotFound,
        NotApproved,
        TokenAlreadyExists,
    }

    #[derive(scale::Decode, scale::Encode, Clone)]
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo, ink::storage::traits::StorageLayout))]
    pub struct Card {
        name: String,
        attack: u32,
        defense: u32,
    }

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct NftCardGame {
        owner: AccountId,
        cards: Mapping<u32, Card>,
        card_owners: Mapping<u32, AccountId>,
        next_token_id: u32,
    }

    impl NftCardGame {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self {
                owner: Self::env().caller(),
                cards: Mapping::default(),
                card_owners: Mapping::default(),
                next_token_id: 1,
            }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn create_card(&mut self, name: String, attack: u32, defense: u32) -> Result<u32, Error> {
            if self.env().caller() != self.owner {
                return Err(Error::NotOwner);
            }

            let token_id = self.next_token_id;
            self.next_token_id += 1;

            let card = Card { name, attack, defense };
            self.cards.insert(token_id, &card);
            self.card_owners.insert(token_id, &self.owner);

            Ok(token_id)
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get_card(&self, token_id: u32) -> Option<Card> {
            self.cards.get(&token_id)
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, token_id: u32) -> Result<(), Error> {
            let owner = self.card_owners.get(&token_id).ok_or(Error::TokenNotFound)?;
            if owner != self.env().caller() {
                return Err(Error::NotApproved);
            }

            self.card_owners.insert(token_id, &to);
            Ok(())
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn play_game(&self, player1_card: u32, player2_card: u32) -> Option<u32> {
            let card1 = self.get_card(player1_card)?;
            let card2 = self.get_card(player2_card)?;
            
            let player1_power = card1.attack + card1.defense;
            let player2_power = card2.attack + card2.defense;
            
            if player1_power > player2_power {
                Some(player1_card)
            } else if player2_power > player1_power {
                Some(player2_card)
            } else {
                None // It's a tie
            }
        }
    }

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[ink::test]
        fn create_card_works() {
            let mut nft_game = NftCardGame::new();
            let token_id = nft_game.create_card("Dragon".to_string(), 100, 50).unwrap();
            assert_eq!(token_id, 1);

            let card = nft_game.get_card(token_id).unwrap();
            assert_eq!(card.name, "Dragon");
            assert_eq!(card.attack, 100);
            assert_eq!(card.defense, 50);
        }

        #[ink::test]
        fn play_game_works() {
            let mut nft_game = NftCardGame::new();
            let token_id1 = nft_game.create_card("Dragon".to_string(), 100, 50).unwrap();
            let token_id2 = nft_game.create_card("Knight".to_string(), 80, 60).unwrap();

            let winner = nft_game.play_game(token_id1, token_id2).unwrap();
            assert_eq!(winner, token_id1);
        }
    }
}
```

This code sets up the basic structure for creating, retrieving, transferring, and playing with NFT cards using only Ink!.

## üî® Step 4: Compile and Deploy

Compile your contract using the following command:

```bash
cargo +nightly contract build
```

This will generate a `.contract` file that you can deploy on a Substrate-based chain.

## üåê Step 5: Deploy and Interact

You can deploy and interact with your contract using tools like the [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/) or by writing a custom frontend application.

## üéâ Conclusion

You've now set up a basic environment to build and interact with an NFT card game using only Ink!. Feel free to expand on this tutorial by implementing more complex game mechanics or adding additional features to your NFT card game.
