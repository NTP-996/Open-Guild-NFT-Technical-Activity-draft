## üöÄ Step 1: Set Up a New Ink! Project

Create a new Ink! project for your NFT card game contract.

```bash
cargo contract new nft_card_game
cd nft_card_game
```

This will create a basic Ink! project structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Add OpenBrush Dependency

Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project and add OpenBrush as a dependency.

```toml
[dependencies]
ink = { version = "5.0.0", default-features = false }
openbrush = { tag = "4.0.0", git = "https://github.com/Brushfam/openbrush-contracts", default-features = false, features = [
    "psp34",
] }
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step 3: Implement NFT Card Game Logic

Create a new file `lib.rs` under the `src` directory and paste the following code:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[openbrush::implementation(PSP34, Ownable)]
#[openbrush::contract]
pub mod nft_card_game {
    use openbrush::contracts::ownable::*;
    use openbrush::contracts::psp34::*;
    use openbrush::traits::Storage;
    use ink::prelude::string::String;
    use ink::prelude::vec::Vec;

    #[derive(Default, Storage)]
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct NftCardGame {
        #[storage_field]
        psp34: psp34::Data,
        #[storage_field]
        ownable: ownable::Data,
        cards: Vec<Card>,
    }

    #[derive(Clone, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)]
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo, ink::storage::traits::StorageLayout))]
    pub struct Card {
        name: String,
        attack: u32,
        defense: u32,
    }

    impl NftCardGame {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            let mut instance = Self::default();
            instance._init_with_owner(Self::env().caller());
            instance
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn create_card(&mut self, name: String, attack: u32, defense: u32) -> Result<(), PSP34Error> {
            self.ensure_owner()?;
            let card = Card { name, attack, defense };
            self.cards.push(card);
            let id = PSP34Id::U32(self.cards.len() as u32);
            self._mint_to(self.env().caller(), id)?;
            Ok(())
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get_card(&self, token_id: u32) -> Option<Card> {
            if token_id > 0 && token_id <= self.cards.len() as u32 {
                Some(self.cards[(token_id - 1) as usize].clone())
            } else {
                None
            }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn play_game(&self, player1_card: u32, player2_card: u32) -> Option<u32> {
            let card1 = self.get_card(player1_card)?;
            let card2 = self.get_card(player2_card)?;
            
            let player1_power = card1.attack + card1.defense;
            let player2_power = card2.attack + card2.defense;
            
            if player1_power > player2_power {
                Some(player1_card)
            } else if player2_power > player1_power {
                Some(player2_card)
            } else {
                None // It's a tie
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code sets up the basic structure for creating, retrieving, and playing with NFT cards.

## üî® Step 4: Compile and Deploy

Compile your contract using the following command:

```bash
cargo +nightly contract build
```

This will generate a `.wasm` file that you can deploy on a Substrate-based chain.

## üåê Step 5: Deploy and Interact using Inkathon

Inkathon provides tools to interact with your smart contract from a TypeScript environment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Create a new Inkathon project:

```bash
npx create-inkathon-app my_inkathon_app
cd my_inkathon_app
npm install
```

### üöÄ Deploy the Contract:

Use the Inkathon framework to deploy your contract:

```typescript
import { deployContract } from '@scio-labs/inkathon';

async function deployNftCardGameContract() {
    const contractAddress = await deployContract({
        codeHash: '<your_contract_code_hash>',
        constructor: '<constructor>',
        gasLimit: '<gas_limit>',
        value: '<value>',
    });
    console.log('Contract deployed at:', contractAddress);
}

deployNftCardGameContract();
```

Replace `<your_contract_code_hash>`, `<constructor>`, `<gas_limit>`, and `<value>` with the appropriate values from your contract.

### üí¨ Interact with the Contract:

Use Inkathon's functions to call your contract methods, such as creating cards, retrieving card information, and initiating gameplay.

```typescript
import { callContractMethod } from '@scio-labs/inkathon';

async function createCard(contractAddress: string, name: string, attack: number, defense: number) {
    const result = await callContractMethod({
        address: contractAddress,
        method: 'create_card',
        args: [name, attack, defense],
        gasLimit: '<gas_limit>',
        value: '<value>',
    });
    console.log('Card creation result:', result);
}

createCard('<contract_address>', 'Dragon', 100, 50);
```

## üéâ Conclusion

You've now set up a basic environment to build and interact with an NFT card game using Ink! and OpenBrush, with deployment and interaction facilitated by Inkathon. Feel free to expand on this tutorial by implementing more complex game mechanics or adding additional features to your NFT card game. For more information, explore the [Ink! documentation](https://use.ink/), the [OpenBrush GitHub repository](https://github.com/Brushfam/openbrush-contracts), and the [Inkathon GitHub repository](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) for more advanced use cases and examples.
